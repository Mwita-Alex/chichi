            <h3>Brief description about UCSPAK</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 18px" class="text-black">
              Universities and Colleges Studentsâ€™ Peace Association of Kenya (UCSPAK) is a non-profit
                student association whose major objective is to promote peace and good governance in institutions
                of higher learning in Kenya. UCSPAK was formed after the 2015 Garissa University terror attack. The Association started as the Zero radicalization campaign. Currently UCSPAK has representatives
                in 69 Universities and Colleges in Kenya representing the interest of over 2 million undergraduate
                students, mostly age 18-24 years.
                <p style="font-size: 18px" class="text-black"> Our theory of change emphasizes on youth, especially those in the
                institutions of higher learning as key agents of change, specifically in the use of non-violent actions
                to bring about social change. We believe that Students too can be used to build bridges across
                communities, and work together to mitigate violent conflicts and promote peaceful coexistence. </p>
                <h6 class="text-success">UCSPAK interventions are focused on five (5) areas namely:</h6>
